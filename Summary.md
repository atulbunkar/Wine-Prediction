# Wine-Prediction Assignment

I have uploaded 2 notebooks :-  1. EDA-wine and 2. Preprocess and modelling .

I used supervisied models to predict Wine based on its location and user Reviews !

I used F1-micro as performance metric for our multiclass - classification problem !

Features Used - ['user_name', 'country', 'review_description',
       'designation', 'points', 'price', 'province', 'region_1', 'winery',
       'variety' ]
       Basically all feature except Review_title and Region_2 . 
 
### Model Used and its Accuracy on CV ( Split on train ) :-
1. Dummy KNN - F1 - 0.53
2. Random Forest - F1 Score - 0.79
3. XGB - F1 Score - 0.747

So , For test label prediction I used Random Forest.

I have attached the 'test with preds.csv' which has 'pred_variety' and all features that I used in my model.

### Note : This test csv file has sorted rows by country so will look diffrent from original test as rows are inter-changed. 

I also attached 'Final_train.csv' with all processed features used.
